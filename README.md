## Abstract 
 This work presents RiDDLE, short for Reversible and Diversified De-identification with Latent Encryptor, to protect the identity information of people from being misused. Built upon a pre-learned StyleGAN2 generator, RiDDLE manages to encrypt and decrypt the facial identity within the latent space. The design of RiDDLE has three appealing properties. First, the encryption process is cipher-guided and hence allows diverse anonymization using different passwords. Second, the true identity can only be decrypted with the correct password, otherwise the system will produce another de-identified face to maintain the privacy. Third, both encryption and decryption share an efficient implementation, benefiting from a carefully tailored lightweight encryptor. Comparisons with existing alternatives confirm that our approach accomplishes the de-identification task with better quality, higher diversity, and stronger reversibility. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of RiDDLE in anonymizing videos. Code and models will be made publicly available.

## Usage 

### Environment
To run the inference and the training scripts, first you need to set up a virtual environment by `conda env create -f RiDDLE.yaml`

### Inference
To perform identity encryption and decryption, just `python coach_test.py`

### Train
To train a latent encryptor, just `sh scripts/run_coach_id_pwd_same.sh`

We also support Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training, `sh scripts/run_coach_id_pwd_same_ddp.sh`. 

### Data and Pretrain models
Our data and pretrain models can be found at [this link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Yf65Q8wah3N305MttL2B8g), password is `sqp8`


## Video De-identification Results

We combine our method with [Stitch Tuning](https://github.com/rotemtzaban/STIT) to de-identify videos.
